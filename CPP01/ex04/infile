BANANA Make a program called replace that takes a BANANA BANANAfilename and two strings, let’s call them s1 and s2, which are NOT empty BANANA.
It will open the file, and write its contents to FILENAME.replace, after replacing every occurrence of s1 with s2.
All the member functions of the class BANANA std::string are allowed, except replace. Use them wisely!
Of course, you will handle errors as best you can. Do not use the C file manipulation functions, because that would be cheating, BANANA and cheating’s bad, m’kay?
You will turn in some test files to show your program BANANA works.
