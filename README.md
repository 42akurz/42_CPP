# CPP Modules - 42 School Project

## About
* The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming and C++.
* Note that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the using namespace <ns_name> and friend keywords are forbidden.
* You are allowed to use the STL in Module 08 only. That means: no Containers (vector/list/map/and so forth) and no <alogorithm> until then.

* **Note: C++98 version**
